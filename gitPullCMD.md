## Git Pull Commands

Please follow these guidelines while using git pull commands to ensure a smooth workflow in your repository:


 - Always pull the latest changes before starting new work to keep your branch updated.

 - Use git pull origin <branch-name> to fetch and merge the latest changes from a specific branch.

 - Prefer git pull --rebase origin <branch-name> to keep a clean commit history.

 - Ensure you resolve any merge conflicts before pushing your changes.

 - If there are local changes that prevent pulling, use git pull --rebase --autostash origin <branch-name>.

 - Run git pull --all if you need to fetch updates for all remote branches.

 - Avoid unnecessary merge commits by using the --rebase flag when pulling updates.

 - If merge conflicts occur, manually resolve them and commit the changes before pushing.

 - Always check for spelling and grammar in commit messages when resolving conflicts.

 - Ensure your local branch is in sync with the remote repository before making further changes.
