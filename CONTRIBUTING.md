Contribution Guide & Guidelines ðŸš€
Welcome to the Awesome First Pull Request Opportunities project! We're excited that you're interested in contributing.

This guide is designed to help you add new repositories to the list with ease and confidence. It provides a step-by-step overview of the process and expectations.

Before you begin, please review the repository requirements section to understand what makes a good addition.

Note: This list is curated for more substantial open-source projects. Please refrain from submitting small personal projects solely in hopes of attracting contributors. Thank you for understanding.

âœ… Initial Checks
Search for Duplicates: Please review the current list and past pull requests to avoid submitting a duplicate entry.

ðŸ“Œ Repository Requirements
Reasonably Developed: The repository must be reasonably established, with a clear goal or function. New repositories that contain few commits and limited content are likely to be rejected.

Active Maintenance: Ensure that the repository is actively maintained.

Appropriate Labels: The repository should have beginner-friendly issue labels (e.g., good-first-issue, low-hanging-fruit). If a label isnâ€™t clearly beginner-friendly, confirm its intent with the repository maintainers.

Supportive Community: The repository should foster a welcoming and helpful environment for newcomers.

ðŸ›  Making Changes and Opening a Pull Request (PR)
1. Edit the data.json File Directly on GitHub
The simplest way to contribute is by editing the data.json file directly in your browser:

Go to the data.json file in the repository.

Click the Edit button (pencil icon) in the top-right corner.

Add your entry by copying an existing one and updating the information to reflect your suggestion.

Ensure the following guidelines are met:

Direct Links: Use links that point directly to the repository. No tracking or promotional links.

Spelling and Grammar: Double-check your submission for language accuracy.

Trailing Whitespace: Avoid adding any trailing whitespace at the end of lines.

Single Addition: Submit one pull request per repository suggestion.

New Technologies: If your addition introduces a new technology, simply add itâ€”a new heading will be automatically generated.

Write a clear and concise commit message describing your change.

Click "Propose changes" to create a branch and open a pull request.

2. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
After proposing changes, GitHub will prompt you to open a PR.

In the PR form:

Make the title and description informative and specific.

If the repository uses an uncommon label for beginner issues, include a reference or link showing that the label is beginner-friendly.

Submit the PR and await review by the maintainers.

3. Reporting an Issue
If you have a suggestion or encounter a problem but don't want to open a PR:

Open an issue instead.

Provide the following:

A clear description of the issue or suggestion.

The expected behavior (for features or enhancements).

The current behavior (for bugs or regressions).
