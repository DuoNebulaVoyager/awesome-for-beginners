# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure that your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

1. **Check for Duplicates:** Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
2. **Relevance and Usefulness:** Ensure your contribution is useful and relevant. It should have enough content, and every item should include a good, succinct description.
3. **Individual Pull Requests:** Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
4. **Edit `data.json` Only:** Only include your suggested repository in the `data.json` file. The `README.md` file is generated from it.
5. **Categorization:** New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
6. **Spelling and Grammar:** Check your spelling and grammar.
7. **Remove Trailing Whitespace:** Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
8. **Meaningful Titles:** The pull request and commit should have a meaningful title.
9. **Describe Your Pull Request:** Provide a clear description of your pull request.
10. **Label Confirmation:** If the label does not clearly state its "beginner friendly" purpose, confirm with the maintainer that it is used for such issues. Include a link to where the maintainer approves it.
11. **Multiple Beginner-Friendly Labels:** If the repository has more than one beginner-friendly-like label (e.g., `low-hanging-fruit` and `up-for-grabs`), maintainer confirmation is required.
12. **Active Maintenance and Community:** The contributed repository must be maintained, have an active community to help newcomers, and have issues with an appropriate label.
13. **Direct Links Only:** Links must point directly to the repository; no tracking links are allowed. This list is not for advertising purposes.

Thank you for your suggestions!
