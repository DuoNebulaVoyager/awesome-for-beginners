## How to Contribute

### 1. **Edit the `data.json` File Directly on GitHub**
The easiest way to contribute is by editing the `data.json` file directly in your browser. Here's how:

1. Go to the [`data.json` file](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/blob/main/data.json) in the repository.
2. Click the **"Edit"** button (pencil icon) in the top right corner.
3. Make your changes directly in the browser:
   - Copy an existing entry in the file.
   - Fill in your own information following the same format.
4. Describe your changes in the commit message.
5. Click **"Propose changes"** to create a new branch and open a Pull Request (PR).

GitHub will guide you through the rest of the process to submit your PR.
