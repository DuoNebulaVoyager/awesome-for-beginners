Perl is a general-purpose, high level interpreted and dynamic programming language. 
At the beginning level, Perl was developed only for system management and text handling but in later versions, Perl got the ability to handle regular expressions, and network sockets, etc. 
At present Perl is popular for its ability to handling the Regex(Regular Expressions). 
The first version of Perl was 1.0 which was released on December 18, 1987. 
Perl 6 is different from Perl 5 because it is a fully object-oriented reimplementation of Perl 5.
