# Personal Stock Price Monitor [Python]

This is a project I am currently working using Python.
It combines web app dev, automation and data analysis
for personal usage.

### Purpose of This Project

The purpose was to make it easier to understand trends

learning algorithms to give an investor an understand of the
current status of the markets.
