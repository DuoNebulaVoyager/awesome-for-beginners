### Blockchain -
Key developer tools required are:
1. Geth- It is a gateway to ethereum network also known as a node, using geth we can connect to blockchain, create our own blockchain, create and manage accounts,
fund with mining or transfer, deploy compiled contracts and, interact with deployed contracts.
2. Mist - It is a web browser that includes i wallet manager to let you easily create and manage accounts, can connect to mainnet or testnet, create and manage accounts, fund with mining or transfer, compile and deploy contracts, and, interact with deployed contracts.
3. Parity - It is similar to geth but has bit more functionality like it can manage multiple accounts for same wallets, it generates automatic keys for accounts, uses web3 and DAP explorer, can develop the smart contracts.
4. MetaMask - It is a chrome and firefox browser extension that stores account addresses and private signing keys, connect with private/public blockchain, create and fund accounts, deploy compiled contracts, interact with deployed contracts, include web3 object.
5. Remix - It is a web based solidity smart contract development IDE with an integrated debugger and testing environment, inbuilt support for finding bugs and can compile multiple solidity files, can deploy contracts, create and fund accounts, 5 pre funded accounts with 100 ETH each are created for testing purposes.
6. Truffle - It is a most popular development framework for ethereum, it has automated testing environment, connect to public/private blockchain, compile and deploy contracts, interact with deployed contracts.
7. Ganache - It works in conjunction with truffle suite, provide 10 test accounts with 100 ETH each, create private blockchain, deploy contracts using web3 object and interact with deployed contracts.
8. Web3js - It is a collection of JS libraries that allow us to easily communicate with local/remote ethereum nodes using http or IPC connection, has account management via node, deploy compiled contracts, interact with deployed contracts.
9. IPFS/SWARM - Interplanetary file sharing system and swarm are decentralized file storage solutions for web3.0, it stores large datasets and creates a cryptographic hash and this reference hashing is then stored in the smart contract.
